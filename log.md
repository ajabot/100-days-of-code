# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 31, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Started to build a Sudoku app with react native.

**Thoughts** I struggled a lot with the styling but I was able to have a basic grid to experiment some row and column highlighting when clicking on a tile.

### Day 2: June 1, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Now displaying the whole grid of the sudoku app, and improved style. Also solved all levels of Flexbox Froggy game

**Thoughts** Although there will be some refactoring/optimizations, I'm really happy with what the app is starting to look like.

### Day 3: June 2, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Changed the component structure to now have Grid > Block > Tile

**Thoughts** More side effects than expected, especially some weird behavior with the grid state. Also struggled with passing callbacks to grandchildren components. I think I found the solution to my problems though

### Day 4: June 3, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the issues with the new component architecture, and also work on the control panel that will be used to input numbers.

**Thoughts** Now that it looks not too bad, I can work on the game logic, and will probably use redux to help with action / data management

### Day 5: June 4, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started to dive into Redux, checked the doc and started to implement it within the sudoku app
