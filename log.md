# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 31, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Started to build a Sudoku app with react native.

**Thoughts** I struggled a lot with the styling but I was able to have a basic grid to experiment some row and column highlighting when clicking on a tile.

### Day 2: June 1, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Now displaying the whole grid of the sudoku app, and improved style. Also solved all levels of Flexbox Froggy game

**Thoughts** Although there will be some refactoring/optimizations, I'm really happy with what the app is starting to look like.

### Day 3: June 2, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Changed the component structure to now have Grid > Block > Tile

**Thoughts** More side effects than expected, especially some weird behavior with the grid state. Also struggled with passing callbacks to grandchildren components. I think I found the solution to my problems though

### Day 4: June 3, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the issues with the new component architecture, and also work on the control panel that will be used to input numbers.

**Thoughts** Now that it looks not too bad, I can work on the game logic, and will probably use redux to help with action / data management

### Day 5: June 4, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started to dive into Redux, checked the doc and started to implement it within the sudoku app

**Thoughts** Not as productive as I wanted code wise, but I'm getting the hang of how redux works

### Day 9: June 9, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on improving the architecture of the solution for the technical assessment for the job interview.

**Thoughts** Very busy week end, coulnd't work at least one hour on the challenge both day, so the work of yesterday and today will count for only one day. Didn't write a lot of code per se, but the reflexion on how it should will make the writing easier.

### Day 11: June 11, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on improving the solution for the technical exercice for the job interview. Also tried to fix the builds issues I had with the sudoku reatc native app

**Thoughts** Decided to change something in the architecture of the technical exercice, so it's gonna take a little bit longer. Regarding the app build, I could fix the app but now I'm having a hard time lauching the app in the android / ios emulators.
